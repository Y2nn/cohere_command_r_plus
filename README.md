# Cohere Command R+

### What Is Cohere Command R+?

Command R+ is Cohere's latest and state-of-the-art LLM. The model excels in conversational interactions and long-context tasks. It is particularly optimized for complex Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows and multi-step tool use.

### Cohere Command R+ key features
These are some of the most relevant features of the Command R+ model.

- Longer context length: The model performs language tasks at a higher quality and more reliably than previous models, with a longer context length of up to 128k tokens and a maximum output of 4k tokens.
- Multilingual capabilities: Command R+ has been trained on a diverse corpus of texts in multiple languages, enabling it to perform various text-generation tasks. It is optimized for English, French, Spanish, Italian, German, and more languages. 
- Cross-lingual capabilities: The model can perform cross-lingual tasks, such as translation or answering questions.
- Retrieval augmented generation: You don't need LangChain or other AI frameworks to perform RAG with Command R+. Just supply additional documents to the chat function, and it will generate context-aware responses with citations indicating the source. 
- Multi-step tool use: Connect the model with a search engine tool or create your tool to connect with databases and APIs. This allows the model to communicate with multiple external sources and generate up-to-date, relevant responses to the query. 

### Exploring Key Features of the Command R+ Python API

Now, we will explore the Cohere Python API to generate responses with history, stream responses and get predictable outputs. We will also perform RAG, convert text into embeddings, and fine-tune the model on a custom dataset.
